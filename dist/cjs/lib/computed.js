/**
 * computed.js implements a computed observable, whose value depends on other observables and gets
 * recalculated automatically when they change.
 *
 * E.g. if we have some existing observables (which may themselves be instances of `computed`),
 * we can create a computed that subscribes to them explicitly:
 *  let obs1 = observable(5), obs2 = observable(12);
 *  let computed1 = computed(obs1, obs2, (use, v1, v2) => v1 + v2);
 *
 * or implicitly by using `use(obs)` function:
 *  let computed2 = computed(use => use(obs1) + use(obs2));
 *
 * In either case, computed1.get() and computed2.get() will have the value 17. If obs1 or obs2 is
 * changed, computed1 and computed2 will get recomputed automatically.
 *
 * Creating a computed allows any number of dependencies to be specified explicitly, and their
 * values will be passed to the read() callback. These may be combined with automatic dependencies
 * detected using use(). Note that constructor dependencies have less overhead.
 *
 *  let val = computed(...deps, ((use, ...depValues) => READ_CALLBACK));
 *
 * You may specify a `write` callback by calling `onWrite(WRITE_CALLBACK)`, which will be called
 * whenever set() is called on the computed by its user. If a `write` bacllback is not specified,
 * calling `set` on a computed observable will throw an exception.
 *
 * Note that pureComputed.js offers a variation of computed() with the same interface, but which
 * stays unsubscribed from dependencies while it itself has no subscribers.

// TODO Consider mplementing .singleUse() method.
// An open question is in how to pass e.g. kd.hide(computed(x, x => !x)) in such a way that
// the temporary computed can be disposed when temporary, but not otherwise. A function-only
// syntax is kd.hide(use => !use(x)), but prevents use of static subscriptions.
//
// (a) function-only use of computeds is fine and useful.
// (b) pureComputed is another option, and doesn't technically require getting disposed.
// (c) kd.hide(compObs), kd.autoDispose(compObs) is more general and
//     can be replaced more concisely by kd.hide(compObs.singleUse())
// .singleUse() automatically disposes a computed (or an observable?) once there are no
// subscriptions to it. If there are no subscriptions at the time of this call, waits for the next
// tick, and possibly disposes then.
