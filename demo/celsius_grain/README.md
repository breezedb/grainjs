Temperature calculator built using GrainJS.

To build and see this Grain-based demo in action, run from project root:

  npm run build-demo

Or alternatively, in this directory (you can find both scripts in `node_modules/.bin`):

  browserify index.js | minify -o build-index.js

Then open file index.html in a browser.
